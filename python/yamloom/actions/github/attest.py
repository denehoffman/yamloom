class AttestBuildProvenance(ActionStep):
    """Generate provenance attestations for build artifacts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        The name of the step to display on GitHub.
    version
        The branch, ref, or SHA of the action's repository to use.
    subject_path
        Path to the artifact serving as the subject of the attestation. Must
        specify exactly one of ``subject_path``, ``subject_digest``, or
        ``subject_checksums``. May contain a glob pattern or list of paths (total
        subject count cannot exceed 1024).
    subject_digest
        Digest of the subject for which provenance will be generated. Must be in
        the form ``algorithm:hex_digest`` (e.g. ``sha256:abc123...``). Must specify
        exactly one of ``subject_path``, ``subject_digest``, or
        ``subject_checksums``.
    subject_name
        Subject name as it should appear in the attestation. Required when
        identifying the subject with ``subject_digest``.
    subject_checksums
        Path to checksums file containing digest and name of subjects for
        attestation. Must specify exactly one of ``subject_path``,
        ``subject_digest``, or ``subject_checksums``.
    push_to_registry
        Whether to push the provenance statement to the image registry. Requires
        that ``subject_name`` specify the fully-qualified image name and that
        ``subject_digest`` be specified. Defaults to false.
    create_storage_record
        Whether to create a storage record for the artifact. Requires that
        ``push_to_registry`` is set to true. Defaults to true.
    show_summary
        Whether to attach a list of generated attestations to the workflow run
        summary page. Defaults to true.
    github_token
        The GitHub token used to make authenticated API requests.
    args
        The inputs for a Docker container which are passed to the container's entrypoint.
        This is a subkey of the ``with`` key of the generated step.
    entrypoint
        Overrides the Docker ENTRYPOINT in the action's Dockerfile or sets one if it was not
        specified. Accepts a single string defining the executable to run (note that this is
        different from Docker's ENTRYPOINT instruction which has both a shell and exec form).
        This is a subkey of the ``with`` key of the generated step.
    condition
        A boolean expression which must be met for the step to run. Note that this represents
        the ``if`` key in the actual YAML file.
    id
        A unique identifier for the step which can be referenced in expressions.
    env
        Used to specify environment variables for the step.
    continue_on_error
        Prevents the job from failing if this step fails.
    timeout_minutes
        The maximum number of minutes to let the step run before GitHub automatically
        cancels it (defaults to 360 if not specified).

    Returns
    -------
    Step
        The generated attest build provenance step.
